# -AML-Risk-Assessment-Automation
This project automates the drafting of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) risk assessments for UK-licensed gambling operators. By using predefined criteria and data inputs, it streamlines compliance work by generating structured, regulator-aligned reports that meet the standards of the UK Gambling Commission.
